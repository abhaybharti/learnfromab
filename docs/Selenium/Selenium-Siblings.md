# Selenium Siblings - A cost cutting approach for End-To-End test Automation

Selenium supports Java, so testers can leverage active community & ecosystem of Java. Especially, when we want to automate the events other than web gestures like

- handling Pop-ups
- Voice search
- Captcha
- OTP
- REST calls
- DB verification
- Screen recording
- Files handling
- Generate advanced Test Reports
- BDD-Cucumber-Maven-Git-Jenkins project
- CI/CD pipeline.

  For example

  - FreeTTS for voice search
  - Twilio-Java for OTP verification
  - Tessract for Captcha automation
  - RestAssured-Java for REST calls
  - java.sql library for DB verification
  - Extent reports/Allure Report for reports generation.
