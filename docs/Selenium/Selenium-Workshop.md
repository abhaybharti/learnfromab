# Automation Framework Best Practices and Approaches

## Identification of the Scope of Testing: Company oriented, Product oriented, Project Oriented.

## Identification of the Needs of Testing: Identify Types of testing e.g. FT, Web Services etc. and application / modules to be tested.

## Identification of the Requirements of Testing: Find out the nature of requirements, identify type of actions for each requirement & identify high priority requirements.

## Evaluation of the Test Automation Tool: Evaluation checklist, Identify the candidate tools available in the market, Sample run, rate & select the tools, Implementation & Training

## Identification of the Actions to be automated: Actions, Validations & requirements supported by the Tool

## Design of the Test Automation Framework: Framework guidelines, validations, Actions Involved, Systems involved, Tool Extensibility Support, Customs messages & UML Documentation.

## Design of the Input Data Bank: Types of Input file. Input files � Categorization & Design of file prototypes.

## Development of the Automation Framework: Development of script based upon framework design, Driver scripts, Worker Scripts, Record / Playback, Screen / Window / Transaction, Action / Keyword & Data Driven.

## Population of Input Data Bank: Different Types of data Input, Populate data from different data sources, Manual input of data and Parent � Child data hierarchy.

## Configuration of the Schedulers: Identify scheduler requirements & configure the schedulers.

## Benefits of Test Automation Framework Approach:

### Significant reduction in testing cycle time.

### Comprehensive coverage against requirements.

### Use of a “Common Standard” across the organization / Product team / Project team

### Generation of reusable test scripts ( Utility Functions)

### Systematic maintenance of automation scripts

### Data Pooling
