# Things to Keep in mind when naming a variable

- `Names should be self descriptive with enough context so we don't have to comment out code`
- `Descriptive names are better than comments`
- `Avoid single letter names`
- `prefer explicit over implicit names`
- `Use descriptive loop indexes instead of i, j, k`
- `Avoid double negatives`
- `Use verb as a prefix for the function name`
- `No magic number or magic values, use a variable`
- `Don't use abbreviations or acronyms without sufficient contexts`
- `Make variable name as long as necessary if needed but no longer`
- `A prefix like is, are , or has helps to distinguish a boolean from another variable`
